% The growth of a web application is initialy driven by a programming model favoring enhancements in features.
% Eventually, this model shows its limit in scalability.
% The team needs a disruptive and unsafe shift focused on performances.
% To avoid the choice opposing features and performance improvements, we compile web applications into a high-level language compliant with a more scalable model.
% That enable a external high-level management for performance reasons while keeping the initial programming model.

To develop a web application, one needs to choose between two programming models.
The monolithic one favors features improvements, while the decentralized one favors performance improvements.
To avoid this choice, we compile monolithic web applications into a high-level language compliant with a distributed model.
