\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}

We present in this paper a compiler to transform a \textit{Node.js} web application into independent parts communicating by message streams.
The compiler spots rupture points in the application indicating an interface between two parts.
We believe this compilation can enable incremental scalability for web applications without discarding the monolithic programming model favoring enhancements in features.
