Our work is based on \textit{Node.js}\footnote{\raggedright http://nodejs.org/} by Ryan Dahl.
It is also inspired by works on incremental scalability, like the Staged Event-Driven Architecture of Matt Welsh\cite{Welsh2000}, System S developped in the IBM T. J. Watson research center\cite{Jain2006}.
More recent projects are Spark Streaming\cite{Zaharia2012}, MillWheel\cite{Akidau2013}, Timestream\cite{Qian2013} and Storm\footnote{\raggedright http://storm-project.net/}.
The idea is also inspired by works on DataFlow leading up to Flow-Based programming (FBP)\cite{Morrison1994} and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)\cite{Elliott1997}.
Both FBP and FRP, recently got some attention in the Javascript community, respectively with the projects \textit{NoFlo}\footnote{\raggedright https://github.com/bergie/noflo} and \textit{Bacon.js}\footnote{\raggedright https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js}.
Promises\cite{Liskov1988} are related to our work.
Like callbacks, they bring an asynchronous execution model to a synchronous programming style.
